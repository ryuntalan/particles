A **prism** refracts light, splitting it into distinct colors. When colors combine, white light is produced. 
<br>

Similarly, when making a design decision, we can think of our process like a prism: each input reveals a different aspect of the problem, helping us determine the best path forward.
<br>

There are four core inputs that commonly guide design decisions:



### Data  
Evidence from real-world interactions. Useful for spotting patterns and measuring impact at scale, but can miss context or the "why" behind user behavior.
*Examples: A/B tests, conversion funnels*



### Research  
Insights gathered by observing or engaging with users. While valuable for understanding behaviors and motivations, research can be influenced by biases such as observer or selection bias.
*Examples: Moderated usability testing, interviews, surveys*



### UX Laws  
Best practices rooted in behavioral psychology. These provide helpful heuristics, but should be balanced with context from actual users.  
*Examples: Fitts’s Law, Hick’s Law, Jakob’s Law*



### Taste  
Taste is subjective. Designers may have strong opinions, but good design isn’t about personal preference. It’s about aligning with user needs and the brand’s voice.  
*Examples: Visual direction, microcopy choices*

<br>

### What this means for Product
**Balance the What and the Why**
<br>
Design decisions are strongest when guided by multiple inputs, not just what users do but also why they do it.



**Lead with Evidence, Adapt with Judgment**  <br>
While data and research should lead, good design also considers best practices and taste when evidence is limited.
