As AI reshapes how we create, content is sorting into three domains:


### 1. High-End Human Culture  
- Handmade, emotional, high-effort  
- Examples: theater, painting, creative writing  
- Best for: depth, originality, artistic expression

### 2. Mass-Market AI Content  
- Fast, cheap, algorithm-optimized  
- Examples: Midjourney images, VEO3 vlogs  
- Best for: scale, speed, shock value

### 3. Hyper-Personalized Niche Media  
- Highly tailored to individuals or small communities  
- Examples: fandoms, Strava, Goodreads  
- Best for: relevance, identity, community fit



## What this means for Product

**Personality Wins**  
In a flood of AI content, products that evoke emotion and showcase taste will stand out. Think Apple’s Liquid Glass, Google’s Material 3 Expressive design system, or Airbnb’s 3D icons.

**Design for Communities**  
Building for everyone means connecting with no one. Products that support the needs of specific communities earn trust and traction, like Strava for runners or Goodreads for readers.
