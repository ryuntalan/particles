On June 10th, 2025, researchers from MIT’s Media Lab published a study exploring the cognitive costs of using a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT for writing essays compared to using a search engine or relying solely on one’s own knowledge.

### Key Findings
- Over the course of 4 months, the LLM group consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.  
- LLM participants fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior.  
- LLM essays were more homogeneous and lacked originality.

### What this means for Design

**Don’t Let AI Replace Your Thinking**
<br>
As designers, our ability to write, think clearly, and tell a story is paramount. While tools like ChatGPT can help us move faster, over-reliance on AI may weaken our ability to form original thoughts, recall key points, and develop a strong point of view. Try writing a first draft before prompting AI, or reflect afterward on what you’ve edited or accepted.
